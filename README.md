# Data-Extraction-from-2D-Materials-Encyclopedia-
In this repostiory, I extract the data of 2D materials from 2D Materials Encyclopedia http://www.2dmatpedia.org. The raw file can be obtained from http://www.2dmatpedia.org/download. In the py script, I have extracted several useful information such as formula, space group, band gap, and lattice constants. I have also included the extracted xlsx file in this repository. The raw file provided needs to be corrected to the proper json format (Missing "{" and "}" as well as the comma separator). I have uploaded in this repository as well if anyone needs to extract other info.

2D Materials Encyclopedia is created and hosted by Centre for Advanced 2D Materials, National University of Singapore, which stores 2D materials data obtained from research.
