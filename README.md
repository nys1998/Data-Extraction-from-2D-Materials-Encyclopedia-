# Data-Extraction-from-2D-Materials-Encyclopedia-
In this repostiory, I extract the data collection of 2D materials from 2D Materials Encyclopedia http://www.2dmatpedia.org/download(http://www.2dmatpedia.org/), allowing researchers to quickly search for suitable material. The raw file can be obtained from http://www.2dmatpedia.org/download. In the py script, I have only extracted formula, space group, band gap, and lattice constants. 

2D Materials Encyclopedia is created and hosted by Centre for Advanced 2D Materials, National University of Singapore, which stores data on 2D materials obtained from past and present research.
